# soundfont “kamoepiano301”

“kamoepiano301” is a software instrument (SFZ) created as part of the 2025 (First Term) Artist-in-Residence program hosted by the Hamamatsu City Kamoe Art Center. This work was presented as one of the pieces in the exhibition “Music Becoming a Sign.”

For this project, the upright piano installed at the center was carefully sampled and reconstructed within a software environment. While preserving the unique character of the original instrument, the design emphasizes delicate dynamic control and is crafted as an instrument dedicated to expressive real-time performance.

Rather than being bound by existing conventions or the pursuit of mere “realism,” the goal was to pursue a sound that I genuinely wished to have. Mechanical noises and other elements that might interfere with musical expression were intentionally avoided, in order to shape it as an “instrument” that allows the performer to fully concentrate on expression.

It is my hope that this sound will spread across the world via the internet, carrying the resonance of the Kamoe piano beyond places and borders, encountering diverse forms of expression and giving birth to new music.

## Software Specifications

### Basic Specifications
- Format: SFZ (Plogue sforzando recommended)
- Sample Data: 48kHz / 24bit
- Data Size: Approx. 210MB
- Velocity Layers: 3 layers
- Tone Control: Dynamic filtering based on velocity

### Features
- Although the instrument uses three velocity layers, filter processing is applied to ensure smooth transitions between layers. Rather than simply increasing the number of samples, dynamic tonal changes through filtering are combined to achieve seamless and natural gradation.
- While upright pianos are generally considered to have limited tonal variation depending on touch, this instrument is designed to go beyond that characteristic. From soft to strong keystrokes, both volume and timbre change widely in response to touch, enabling richer expressive possibilities.
- Mechanical noises are intentionally not added. More than reproducing “realism,” priority was given to creating an instrument for performance—one that allows the player to focus on musical expression.
- Care was taken not to over-process the sound into a flat character. Post-recording processing was kept to a minimum in order to preserve the inherent personality of the upright piano at the Kamoe Art Center.
